# Waffles-Modpack-mod-catvm


Hello, my name is Catvin and i have been working on WMM 1.2.0 / Csalt 2.2.0 for a long time now and it's finally out!
A total of 190+ mods were put into this modpack.
I hope you enjoy this modified version of waffle's modpack (at this point it has no traces of the modpack I forked it from: https://modrinth.com/modpack/waffles-modpack)
These mods are allowed on "almost all" servers including the big ones like hypixel. (as far as I know none of these mods are banned on ANY server.)

This modpack is a fabric modpack. (https://fabricmc.net/) I have left the fabric loader jar file in the folder. (fabric api is already in the modpack)

Instalation prossess:
