# Waffles-Modpack-mod-catvm


Hello, my name is Catvin and i have been working on WMM 1.1 / Csalt 2.0.1 for 23 days now and it's finally out!
A total of 149 mods were put into this modpack.
I hope you enjoy this modified version of waffle's modpack (at this point it has no traces of the modpack I forked it from: https://modrinth.com/modpack/waffles-modpack)
These mods are allowed on "almost all" servers including the big ones like hypixel. (as far as I know none of these mods are banned on ANY server.)

This modpack is a quilt modpack. (https://quiltmc.org/) I have left the quilt loader jar file in the folder. (qsl is already in the modpack)

Instalation prossess:

How to install Minecraft mods on a Mac

How to install Minecraft mods on a Mac

My most popular post of all time by far is a documentation page about how to install Minecraft mods on a Mac. Nothing else I’ve ever written has come anywhere close to the popularity of that post. I guess no one really cares how I spent my weekend but clearly a lot of people want to know how to hack Minecraft.

I wrote that old post after going through the process of installing mods for my then seven-year-old son who was determined to play mods. That was almost four years ago and is now out of date so here’s an updated version. Enjoy!

There are three main steps – install Quilt, create a mods folder, install mods. I’m using macOS High Sierra.

Install Quilt

Navigate to the downloads folder and find the file you downloaded. It will end with xxxxx-installer.jar. Right-click the file with your mouse and choose “Open”.

Select “Install Client” from the next screen and click OK.

Create mods folder

Open Finder on your Mac and go to Go > Library in the menu.

Go to Application Support > minecraft in Finder and create a new folder called mods. This is where your mods will go.

Install mods

Find the mod on the web you want to install and download the file to your computer. It will be a file ending in .jar.

Drag and drop the downloaded file into your new mods directory in the ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods folder.

You’re now ready to play the new mod!

When you launch Minecraft be sure to select Quilt from the Play menu.



BSL

sorry BSL users, but I don't know enough about BSL to offer instructions. Try the Linux option if that works! (If you are a BSL user you are probably used to troubleshooting)
