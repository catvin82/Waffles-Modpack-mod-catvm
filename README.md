# Waffles-Modpack-mod-catvm


Hello, my name is Catvin and i have been working on WMM 1.1.2 / Csalt 2.1.2 for 23 days now and it's finally out!
A total of 149 mods were put into this modpack.
I hope you enjoy this modified version of waffle's modpack (at this point it has no traces of the modpack I forked it from: https://modrinth.com/modpack/waffles-modpack)
These mods are allowed on "almost all" servers including the big ones like hypixel. (as far as I know none of these mods are banned on ANY server.)

This modpack is a quilt modpack. (https://quiltmc.org/) I have left the quilt loader jar file in the folder. (qsl is already in the modpack)

Instalation prossess:
